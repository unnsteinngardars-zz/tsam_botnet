# tsam_botnet

This project is a school assignment from Reykjav√≠k University. 
The reason for this repository being public is to showcase code examples. 
Copying this code to use for the same assignment is considered plagiarism 
and will likely result in a penalty carried out by the teacher.

## Server
The server is compiled by running 
```make server``` 
It compiles on macOS and linux

## Client
The client is compiled by running
```make client```
To compile on macOS the makefile must be edited and the lncurses flag must be added behind ```client: $(CLIENT)```

## Version Control
We used github for version control, each small functionality was tested and commited/pushed to git.
